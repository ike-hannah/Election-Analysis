## Overview of Election Audit
Given the election results in the form of a CSV file I used python to create a txt file containg an easy to read audit of the data.

## Eleciton-Audit summary
I belive this script could continue to be useful to the election board. With a modification of the import command at the beggining of the code they analyze any other election results in CSV form. This script could also be modified in future elections to display the voter Ballot ID to search for duplicate ballots or other mistakes to combat election fraud.
